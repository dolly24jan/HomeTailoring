                                                            A room where everything gets equal importance will seem either scattered or boring. You need an anchor. Architectural spaces often have points of interest such as a fireplace or a window with a beautiful view. You can choose to enhance the built in focal point by arranging furniture around it to emphasize it. In a room that lacks such a built in point of interest you can create one through groupings of furniture or using an unusual or large piece.</p>

                                                                <div class="extra-wrap">
                                                     Scale and proportion are both design elements that have to do with size. Scale is the size of one object in relation to the other objects in a design or artwork. Proportion is the ratio between the size of one part to another, and scale is how the size of one object relates to another or to the space in which it is placed. For instance, a large overstuffed sectional in a small room will be out of scale.

Some proportional relationships are more pleasing than others. The ancient Greeks came up with the Golden Section, which sought to reduce all proportion to a simple formula: The ratio of the smaller section to the larger section should be the same as that of the larger section to the whole. This proportion is present in nature, and artists and architects have used it as well. 
                                                                </div>

                                                                 Most of us know what we like but have no idea how to pull it all together. Homes are often beautiful because of the feeling that they invoke, not because of the amount of expensive artwork or designer upholstery that they possess. For example, we’ve all seen someone who has crammed an overstuffed sofa into a small living room. Designers would say that the sofa is the wrong scale for the room.

                              <b> 1. Paint : </b>
Though painting is the cheapest investment you can make, it's also the one with the most dramatic result. Go ahead and put some color on those walls for a fresh — and inexpensive — new look.<br><br>

<b>2. Do It Yourself : </b>
The biggest budget buster is hiring others to do things you could do. Consider what you'll save by taking on some relatively simple projects: painting, tiling, installing a new floor, sewing curtain panels or throw pillows — whatever you feel up to trying.<br><br>

<b>3. Take Advantage of Unused Spaces : </b>
A room with an eave or sloped ceiling can be a perfect place to add storage. In this design, we created a walk-in closet by fitting the space with open shelves and low bookcases. Use matching boxes and baskets to organize loose items and add a bench in the middle for some seating and a place to set things down.

                            <div class="wrapper">
                            	<figure class="img-indent2 frame2"><img src="images/page2-img2.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
                                <div class="extra-wrap">
                                	<b>4. Call in Family and Friends : </b>
You may not have a wad of cash or a lot of home-improvement know-how, but you have other resources that can help get your decorating project off the ground: the people you know. Call on a group of relatives, friends and neighbors who can supply the muscle to rip down wall paneling, roll on paint or assemble a room of flat-packed furniture. Just don't forget to feed them lunch.<br><br>

<b>5. Shop Secondhand Stores : </b>
Thrift stores, consignment shops, church rummage sales, online auction sites, estate sales and even salvage yards offer a bounty of discount decorating booty. Look for furniture with solid construction and classic lines that new upholstery or paint will bring back to life.<br><br>

<b>6. Accent with Wallpaper : </b>
Wallpaper is a fantastic way to add interest in a room. However, you want to be careful how you do it – too much pattern or color can be distracting. For bold patterns, consider adding it to just one wall to energize your room without overwhelming it. In this room, we used a blue damask pattern and a matching dark wall color to tie it all together.
